Readme about compiling Patrocle on different platforms.
------------------------------------------------------

Patrocle has been successfully compiled and runned on :
- GNU/Linux
- MacOS X Leopard (10.5)

Library prerequisites :
- libiconv
- liblua


GNU/Linux 

On GNU/Linux, the installation is the simplest : just install the
needed libs with the package manager dedicated to your distribution,
build.

MacOS X

My own OSX was missing the liblua and libiconv, I installed them with
MacPorts.

Windows XP

The Win32 platform support is not finished yet (will it be in the
future ?). I have just fixed some build issues but there is still some
work on the unix socket porting to winsock. 
I have downloaded libiconv from http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/
and Lua for Windows package from the LuaForge
http://luaforge.net/frs/?group_id=377 The libiconv was built with
MinGW and the makefile was only hacked to get the libs directly in
their build places.
