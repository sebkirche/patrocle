 A session is created:
 - When a user starts a DCC chat connection
 - When a user sends a legal command (public or private)
 - When a user sends an illegal private message (for floodcontrol)
 
 A session is deleted when the user has been idle for a defined
 amount of time.
 
 Sessions can be used for "remembering" the cwd (with filetransfer),
 last used command, floodingcontrol etc.
